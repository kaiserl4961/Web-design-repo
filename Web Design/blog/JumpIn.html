                In the beginning you might want to choose a language that you already know. If you are a beginner you might want to choose a language that is easy to learn. If you are an experienced programmer you might want to choose a language that is easy to learn
                but that is also easy to use.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just choose a language that you are interested in and that you feel has value for you.
